    title: "Uber Data Analysis",
    description: "Analyzed 10K+ Uber ride records to uncover demand trends and peak-hour patterns.",
    keyInsight: "Peak ride demand increases by 35% during 6–9 PM.",
    problem: "Uber struggles with vehicle allocation during varying demand periods, leading to longer wait times and lost revenue.",
    dataset: "10,000+ historical Uber ride records containing timestamps, pickup/drop-off locations, and trip statuses.",
    approach: [
        "Performed extensive data cleaning to handle missing values and correct datetime formats.",
        "Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trip frequency by hour, day, and month.",
        "Visualized demand-supply gaps across different city zones using heatmaps.",
        "Analyzed cancellation rates and reasons during peak traffic hours."
    ],
    businessImpact: "Identified key surge periods, allowing for optimized driver allocation which could potentially reduce wait times by 15% and increase daily revenue.",
    recommendations: [
        "Deploy dynamic driver incentives during peak evening hours (6–9 PM) to align vehicle supply with demand spikes.",
        "Implement anti-cancellation measures and driver bonuses in high-friction pickup zones to improve trip completion rates.",
        "Integrate predictive machine learning models to forecast hourly demand and optimize shift routing for drivers."
